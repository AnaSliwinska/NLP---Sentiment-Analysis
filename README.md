# NLP sentiment analysis

##Introduction

The sentiment analysis – NLP it was part of project „The prediction of price in Stock Exchange”. The data to sentiment analysis was webscrapped from website bankier.pl. The text analysis was made for each Polish companies listed on the Stock Echange.

The first step of NLP – sentiment analysis was to import the required libraries and the dataset. Next step there was to perform text preprocessing to covert textual data to numeric data that can be used by a machine learning algorithm. The last step was to make machine learning algorithms to train and test sentiment analysis models.

The Naive Bayes classifier was used to making prediction on the model and the confusion matrix and accuracy scores were used to evaluating on the model.
